## Abstract
In the lung airways, multiple cell types facilitate airflow to alveoli, clearing out debris, particles, and pathogens. These vital processes are impeded in chronic inflammatory
respiratory diseases. There, the epithelium typically suffers from inflammation, infections, and hypoxia. An increasing body of evidence highlights the critical role of modifier genes in
responses and resistance against these pathogenic processes. Here, we sought to study the transcription factor EHF,suggested by previous studies as a putative modifier gene, yet whose
functional role remains ambiguous. To address this question, we investigated the phenotypical and functional effects of EHF-knocked out on human induced Pluripotent Stem
Cells-derived Airway Epithelial Cells. The loss of EHF enhanced Cystic fibrosis transmembrane conductance regulator activity, altered basal cell state, increased Trans-Epithelial Electrical
Resistance, and reduced HIF-1α-mediated response to hypoxia. Here, we show that variation in EHF levels may impact lung diseases through several mechanisms, thereby highlighting
prospects for novel therapies.
