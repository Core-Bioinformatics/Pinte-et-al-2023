## Abstract
One of the most common genetic diseases, Cystic Fibrosis (CF), is caused by loss or dysfunction of an ion channel, the CF Transmembrane conductance Regulator (CFTR). Most morbimortality is due to the lung disease which severity is only partially explained by CFTR mutations. Other genes thought to be implicated were outlined by Genome-Wide Association Studies. Here, we investigate one of them, the transcription factor EHF. Though this gene was previously explored, the effect on lung disease remains unclear. We knocked out EHF from induced pluripotent stem cells and differentiated clones into airways cells in air-liquid interface cultures. Cells were sent for scRNAseq and we found a set of differentially expressed genes and basal cell state changes. Moreover, in hypoxic conditions, we found differentially expressed genes and a reduced HIF1Î± response. Our results suggest low EHF levels could reduce CF lung disease severity and provide prospects for novel therapies.
